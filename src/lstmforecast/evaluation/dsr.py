"""Probabilistic and Deflated Sharpe ratios (Bailey & Lopez de Prado, 2014).

These overfitting guards adjust a realized Sharpe ratio for sample length,
non-normality (skew and kurtosis), and — for the Deflated Sharpe — the number of
configurations tried (multiple-testing / selection bias). The Deflated Sharpe is
the honest yardstick that counts the FULL configuration grid as ``n_trials``.

MIGRATED to the shared ``quantcore`` package: the PSR/DSR kernels here are
byte-identical to ``quantcore.probabilistic_sharpe_ratio`` /
``quantcore.deflated_sharpe_ratio`` (validated to 1e-8 against ``scipy.stats``).
These public names are thin wrappers over quantcore that translate
``quantcore.ValidationError`` into this package's own
:class:`lstmforecast._exceptions.ValidationError` with IDENTICAL messages (the
two packages have no shared exception ancestry, so callers that ``except
lstmforecast ... ValidationError`` keep working unchanged).

Importing this module has no side effects.
